# AI-Based-Automated-Video-Creator-from-Text
This project automatically generates a video from a given text input. It extracts important sentences or keywords from the text, creates images based on those keywords using a text-to-image model, and generates audio narration using text-to-speech technology. The images and audio are then combined into a cohesive video output.
